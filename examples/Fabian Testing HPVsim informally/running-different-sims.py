"""NOTE:Because multiprocess pickles the sims when running them, sims[0] (before being run by the multisim) 
and msim.sims[0] are not the same object. After calling msim.run(), always use sims from the multisim object, 
not from before. In contrast, if you donâ€™t run the multisim (e.g. if you make a multisim from already-run sims),
 then sims[0] and msim.sims[0] are indeed exactly the same object.
